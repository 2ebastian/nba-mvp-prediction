    """
    Perform advanced feature engineering on cleaned NBA player data.

    This function applies multiple transformations and dimensionality 
    reductions on a cleaned dataset, including:
    
    - Ranking teams by conference and season based on win percentage.
    - Computing per-game statistics to reduce season length bias (e.g. due to lockdowns).
    - Organizing features into logical groups for readability and consistency.
    - Dropping highly correlated or redundant features based on corr-SHAP analysis.
    - Saving the final processed DataFrame to a timestamped CSV file.

    Args:
        df_cleaned (str): Path to the cleaned CSV file.
        output_path (str): Directory where the final CSV file will be saved.

    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: The engineered DataFrame ready for model training.
        str: The path to the saved CSV file.
